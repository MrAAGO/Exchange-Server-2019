 <section id="mailbox">
      <h2>Create Users Mailbox</h2>
  
  <p>
  A user mailbox in Exchange Server is a mailbox that is associated with a specific user. It is the primary mailbox for an individual user and is used to store and manage their email messages, calendar items, contacts, tasks, and other data. A user mailbox is created when a new user is added to an organization's Exchange Server and is typically accessed through a client such as Outlook or Outlook Web Access (OWA).
  
To create a user mailbox in Exchange Server 2019, you can use the Exchange Management Shell (EMS) to run the following command:

  ![carbon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86381942/212557957-f7f20266-70fe-471d-bb6d-b96a833ca51c.png)

  This command creates a new mailbox for a user named John Smith, with the alias "jsmith" and the email address "jsmith@example.com". The user's first name is "John" and last name is "Smith". The password for the mailbox is "Pa$$w0rd", which is passed as a secure string. The mailbox is created on the database "Mailbox Database".</p>
 
  You can also use the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) in the GUI to create a mailbox:
 
  <li>Log in to the EAC.</li>
  
  <li>Go to recipients>mailboxes.</li>
  
   <li>Click the + button.</li>

   <li>Select user mailbox.</li>
        
   <li>Fill out the form with the required information, including the user's name, email address, and password.</li>
    
 <li>Select the mailbox database where you want to create the mailbox..</li
    
 <li>Click save</li>

<section id="database">
      <h2>Rename and Move a Mailbox Database</h2>
  
  <b>To rename and move a mailbox database in Exchange Server 2019, you can use the Exchange Management Shell (EMS) to perform the following steps:</b>

<li>Rename the mailbox database: Use the following command to rename the mailbox database:</li>
  
`Rename-MailboxDatabase -Identity "OldName" -NewName "NewName"`
  
<li>Move the mailbox database: Use the following command to move the mailbox database to a new location::</li>

`Move-MailboxDatabase -Identity "NewName" -EdbFilePath "D:\NewLocation\NewName.edb`
 
  You need to change the path of the edb file to the location you want to move the mailbox database to.

<li>You need to change the path of the edb file to the location you want to move the mailbox database to.

Mount the mailbox database: Use the following command to mount the mailbox database in its new location:</li>
`Mount-Database "NewName`

 It's important to note that you should schedule a maintenance window and make sure that there are no active users on the mailbox database when you are renaming and moving it, and also that you should have the necessary permissions to perform this task.

You can also use the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) in the GUI to rename and move a mailbox database:

  <li>Go to servers, then databases</li>
<li>Select the database you want to move and click on more</li>
<li>then choose move database path.</li>
<li>Fill out the form with the new path</li>
<li>Click on move</li>
<li>You should also be logged in as a member of the Organization Management role group or the Recipient Management role group to perform this task.</li>

      <h2>Create a New Mailbox Database in Exchange 2019</h2>
<b>To create a new mailbox database in Exchange Server 2019, you can use the Exchange Management Shell (EMS) to run the following command:</b>
  
![carbon (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86381942/212561080-864bb6b6-8af9-44e9-9867-6db838cfdb61.png)
 
  `New-MailboxDatabase -Name "NewMailboxDatabase" -Server "ServerName" -EdbFilePath "D:\MailboxDatabases\NewMailboxDatabase.edb" -LogFolderPath "D:\MailboxDatabases\NewMailboxDatabase`
  
  This command creates a new mailbox database named "NewMailboxDatabase" on the server "ServerName". The mailbox database's .edb file is stored in the "D:\MailboxDatabases" folder and the log files are stored in the "D:\MailboxDatabases\NewMailboxDatabase" folder.

You can also use the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) in the GUI to create a new mailbox database:

  <li>Go to servers, then databases</li>
  
<li>Click the + button.</li>
  
<li>Fill out the form with the required information, including the name of the new mailbox database, the server it will be located on, and the path for the .edb file and the log files.</li>
  
<li>Click save.</li>
  
It's important to note that you should schedule a maintenance window and make sure that there are no active users on the mailbox database when you are creating it, and also that you should have the necessary permissions to perform this task.
You should also be logged in as a member of the Organization Management role group or the Recipient Management role group to perform this task.

You can also specify other parameters such as the maximum size of the database, the retention policy, the mailbox database replication, and more.

It's also worth noting that the folder path for the edb and log files should exist before the creation of the mailbox database, and that the folder should have the proper permission to the service account running the mailbox role.

      <h2>Create Resource Mailboxes in Exchange 2019</h2> 
  Resource mailboxes in Exchange Server 2019 are used to manage and schedule resources such as conference rooms, equipment, or other shared resources. Here are the steps to create a resource mailbox in Exchange Server 2019:

<li><b>Open the Exchange Management Shell: Open the Exchange Management Shell on the Exchange server.</li></b>

<li><b>Create the resource mailbox: Use the following command to create the resource mailbox:</li></b>

  `New-Mailbox -Name ConfRoom1 -DisplayName "Conference Room 1" -Room`

<section id="distribution">
      <h2>Create Distribution Group in Exchange 2019</h2>
      
A distribution group, also known as a distribution list, is a feature in Exchange Server that allows you to send an email to a group of people without having to add each recipient individually.

Distribution groups are used to create email addresses that represent a group of people, such as a department, project team, or group of external partners. Once the distribution group is created, you can add members to it, and then use the group's email address to send emails to all members of the group at once  

**There are two types of Distribution groups**

Distribution Group: This group is used for sending emails to the group members and it doesn't have a mailbox.
Mail-Enabled Distribution Group: This group is used for sending emails to the group members and it also has a mailbox.

To create a distribution group in Exchange 2019 using PowerShell, you can use the New-DistributionGroup cmdlet. Here are the steps:

<li>Open the Exchange Management Shell on your Exchange Server.
<li>Type the following command to create a new distribution group:

```powershell
New-DistributionGroup -Name "Marketing Team" -Type "Distribution" -PrimarySmtpAddress "marketing@yourdomain.com" -OrganizationalUnit "OU=Marketing,DC=yourdomain,DC=com"
```
  
<b>You can also configure other settings for the distribution group by including them in the command. For example, you can specify the email address for the group with the -PrimarySmtpAddress parameter, set the group's members with the -Members parameter, and set the group's permissions with the -ManagedBy parameter.</b>

`New-DistributionGroup -Name "Marketing Team" -Type "Distribution" -PrimarySmtpAddress "marketing@contoso.com" -Members "John Smith","Jane Doe" -ManagedBy "admin@contoso.com`

<li>You can also use the following command to add a Distribution Group Manager</li>

`Add-DistributionGroupMember -Identity "Marketing Team" -Member "Manager1`

Once the distribution group is created, you can use the Get-DistributionGroup cmdlet to verify that the group has been created, and use the Set-DistributionGroup cmdlet to modify the group's settings.
