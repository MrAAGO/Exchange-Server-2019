      <h2>Create Users Mailbox</h2>
  
  <p>
  A user mailbox in Exchange Server is a mailbox that is associated with a specific user. It is the primary mailbox for an individual user and is used to store and manage their email messages, calendar items, contacts, tasks, and other data. A user mailbox is created when a new user is added to an organization's Exchange Server and is typically accessed through a client such as Outlook or Outlook Web Access (OWA).
  
To create a user mailbox in Exchange Server 2019, you can use the Exchange Management Shell (EMS) to run the following command:

  This command creates a new mailbox for a user named John Smith, with the alias "jsmith" and the email address "jsmith@example.com". The user's first name is "John" and last name is "Smith". The password for the mailbox is "Pa$$w0rd", which is passed as a secure string. The mailbox is created on the database "Mailbox Database".</p>
